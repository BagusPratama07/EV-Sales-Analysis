# ⚡ Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales and Adoption Analysis

This project explores **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales performance and adoption factors** using descriptive and inferential statistics combined with interactive data visualization in Tableau.  
Developed as part of a comprehensive data analytics portfolio project, it aims to uncover key insights behind EV market growth and adoption behavior across regions.

## 🌍 Background

The global adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has accelerated due to increasing awareness of environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, and the transition to renewable energy. Automotive manufacturers are introducing diverse EV models with varying prices and features to attract consumers, making EV sales data highly valuable for analysis.
Despite positive growth trends, EV adoption still faces regional disparities influenced by factors such as charging infrastructure, consumer purchasing power, and preferences for features like battery capacity, price discounts, and fast-charging availability.  
This analysis utilizes the [Electric Vehicle Sales and Adoption Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rameezmeerasahib/electric-vehicle-ev-sales-and-adoption) from Kaggle to identify trends, understand adoption patterns, and provide strategic insights for manufacturers and policymakers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement (SMART Framework)

- **Specific:** Analyze factors influencing EV adoption across regions, focusing on sales trends, brand performance, customer segments, battery capacity, price discounts, and fast-charging features.
- **Measurable:** Evaluate sales trends (monthly/yearly), brand performance, and customer segment distribution, while calculating statistical measures (mean, median, min, max, variance) of sales and revenue per region. Conduct hypothesis testing on the relationship between price discounts and units sold.
- **Achievable:** The analysis is based on a Kaggle dataset containing relevant EV attributes—sales, region, brand, segment, battery capacity, discount, and fast-charging option—making the objectives achievable through visualization and statistical methods.
- **Relevant:** Insights from this analysis will reveal adoption trends, identify key drivers and barriers, and provide actionable recommendations for automotive manufacturers and policymakers.
- **Time-Bound:** The analysis focuses on available 2023 data and is completed within a one-week project timeframe.

## ❓ Research Questions

1. How have EV sales trended over time (monthly or yearly) across regions?
2. How do total units sold differ across EV brands?
3. What is the sales distribution across customer segments?
4. Is there a difference in EV adoption between regions with and without a fast-charging option?
5. What are the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values of sales and revenue, and how do they vary across regions?
6. Does price discount significantly influence the number of EV units sold?
